        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>When it comes to cooking dinner, easy elegance is what I’m going for these days. At first glance, this dish looks downright decadent. But in reality, it’s the poster child for simplicity. It’s like I’m an illusionist in the kitchen!</p>
        <p>Whether you serve it as shrimp scampi pasta for a super quick weeknight meal or serve it to company for a chic nod to your faux fancy cookery, this dinner’s ingredients can always be stocked in the pantry and freezer for a sizzling bite any time.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb large shrimp with shells</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white wine or chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Thaw the shrimp in cool water and remove the shells then devein the shrimp. Discard the shells, rinse and drain the shrimp then transfer to a small bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, half of the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and the red pepper flakes. Toss to coat and set let sit for 20 minutes for flavors to build.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the shrimp and garlic mixture to the skillet, spacing evenly in the pan. Cook for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes then flip the shrimps over when they begin to become opaque. Cook for 1 more minute or so, watching so the shrimp turn golden but don't brown too much and the garlic doesn't burn. Transfer the shrimp to a small bowl or plate. If you have browned bits of garlic, move the skillet from the heat and remove the browned garlic as it will be bitter.</li>
            <li>Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in the skillet over medium heat and add the remaining garlic. Cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant then stir in the white wine and lemon juice. Cook for 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens and reduces by half, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the shrimp with any juices back to the pan and stir in the last tablespoon of butter and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt or to taste. Sprinkle with the minced parsley, stir, and cook for 1 more minute. Serve warm with sourdough bread for dipping, or over pasta or rice.</li>
        </ol>
