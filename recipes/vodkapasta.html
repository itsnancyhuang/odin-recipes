        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is well known as being from Jon & Vinny's. Celebrities, such as Gigi Hadid, have made this pasta dish go viral. It's extremely easy to make and very delicious.</p>
        <p>If you can't have vodka, you may skip it. But it definitely enhances the flavors of the dish. Pick your favorite pasta, it doesn't have to be penne. You can also adjust the spice level to your taste. I like mine very spicy, so I add a lot!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li> 2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes, to taste</li>
            <li>Dried oregano, to taste</li>
            <li>Dried thyme, to taste</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
            <li>1 (4.5 oz) tube of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vodka</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 lb penne pasta</li>
            <li>Salt for pasta water</li>
            <li>Freshly grated parmigiano reggiano (at least 1/2 cup)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh parsley, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large pot of water to cook your pasta. While it heats, start making the sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook your onion with the olive oil and salt in a large pan over medium heat until translucent and slightly golden. Add black pepper, red pepper flakes, oregano, and thyme and cook 1-2 more minutes. Add in the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and continue to cook over medium heat for 2-3 more minutes. Stir continuously with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula.</li>
            <li>Add the vodka; let it simmer briefly before adding the heavy cream. Turn off the heat once the cream simmers for a minute. Use a spoon to remove the garlic cloves that have now infused the sauce.</li>
            <li>Salt the pasta water once it's boiling and add in your rigatoni. Cook 2-3 minutes less than the lower number on the package. Use a mug to reserve at least a half cup of pasta water before draining the pasta.</li>
            <li>Mix the drained pasta into the pan with the sauce, along with a splash of pasta water and a generous amount of parmigiano reggiano and the butter. Return the pan to heat, and let the pasta simmer in the sauce for the last couple minutes of its cook time. Add the parsley and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
